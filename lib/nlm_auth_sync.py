"""Keep NotebookLM auth alive on the servers that generate podcasts.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `nlm` authenticates by extracting cookies from a locally
signed-in browser. Winston and nightshift have no browser, so they can never
refresh their own credential — they can only be handed one. Nothing handed
them one between 2026-07-14 and 2026-08-16, so both quietly aged out and the
research podcast stopped being produced. Nobody noticed for six days because
the pipeline treated "no podcast" as a best-effort skip.

So: the Mac is the only place a refresh can happen, and the servers are
downstream copies. That is not a workaround, it is the actual shape of the
dependency, and this script makes it explicit and scheduled instead of
remembered.

    nlm_auth_sync.py check          # is auth alive here and on each host?
    nlm_auth_sync.py sync           # refresh locally, verify, push, verify again
    nlm_auth_sync.py sync --hosts winston

THREE-STATE REPORTING. Every host reports ok / FAIL / n-a. "Could not tell"
is never rendered as "fine" — an unreachable host is `n-a`, not a pass. The
whole failure being repaired here is a broken thing that looked healthy.

VERIFY, DON'T ASSUME. A copied file proves nothing: the credential may be
expired at the moment it is copied. Both the local refresh and every remote
push are confirmed with a live `notebook list` call, because the only
evidence that auth works is auth working.

NEVER PRINTS THE CREDENTIAL. ~/.nlm/env holds cookies and an auth token.
Identity is shown as a truncated sha256, per the credential-audit convention.
