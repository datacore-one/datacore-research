"""Route research items to evergreen podcast themes and to a work destination.

WHY DETERMINISTIC. Same reason strategic-prioritizer scores tasks by keyword
and not by asking a model: this runs unattended every night, and a router whose
answer moves between runs cannot be debugged from its output. Keywords are
auditable -- when an item lands in the wrong theme you can see which token did
it and fix that token.

TWO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS, deliberately not collapsed into one:

  theme  -- which evergreen NotebookLM notebook the SOURCE joins.
            Themes cross ventures on purpose; that is where the insight is.
  dest   -- where the ACTION goes, if the item implies one.
            `issue` only when a repo can be named AND a change can be named.
            Everything else is `inbox`. When in doubt it is `inbox`, because a
            wrong inbox item costs you ten seconds and a wrong issue is visible
            to your team.

An item can have a theme and no action (most reading), an action and no theme
(a repo chore that came up while reading), or neither -- `discard` exists
because a queue you cannot empty is not a queue. 203 open items with a median
age of 50 days is what happens when every capture must be processed.

WHERE THIS RUNS -- AFTER EXTRACTION, NOT AT CAPTURE. Measured 2026-09-02
against the live queue: given heading + URL + body, this router assigns a theme
to 36 of 203 items. The other 167 are titles like "Ben's Bites: Caught
cheating" that carry no theme signal until the article is fetched. Running this
at capture time therefore files five sixths of the queue as unthemed, which
looks like a router bug and is not one. Feed it the literature note that
knowledge-extractor produces, not the raw capture.

See docs/pipeline-podcasts.md for the pipeline this sits in.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Relevance is a vector, not a theme match.
#
# Theme answers "which notebook does this source join". It does NOT answer
# "is this worth your attention", and conflating the two is why a keyword
# router looks like a relevance engine and is not one. Four axes, scored
# independently, because they disagree in useful ways: a piece can be highly
# timely and strategically irrelevant (most news), or untimely and decisive
# (a paper from March that invalidates a roadmap assumption).
#
#   timeliness  does it decay? News does. A method does not. Scored from the
#               item's age against a per-kind half-life, not a flat cutoff.
#   roadmap     does it touch work that is OPEN right now -- a live milestone,
#               an open PR, a named issue? This is the axis that turns reading
#               into doing, and the only one that can promote to `issue`.
#   strategy    does it move a venture thesis, or merely confirm it?
#               Confirmation is worth less than challenge and is scored lower.
#   meta        does it change HOW we work rather than what we know? Rare,
#               and the highest-value class -- a better method compounds
#               across every future item, which no single fact does.
#
# Scores are 0-3 and deliberately coarse. A finer scale would imply a
# precision keyword matching does not have.
