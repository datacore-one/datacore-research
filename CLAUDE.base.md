# Research Module

Automated research processing with NotebookLM podcast generation.

## Overview

This module processes `research_learning.org` daily during nightshift to:
- Fetch and analyze research URLs
- Generate NotebookLM podcasts (daily news + topical)
- Build industry landscape database
- Create literature notes and atomic zettels
- Produce morning research briefings

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/research-status` | View research queue, recent podcasts, processing stats |
| `/create-podcast` | Create ad-hoc podcast from URLs |
| `/research-daily` | Manually trigger daily processing |

## Agents

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `daily-research-processor` | Sonnet | Nightshift orchestrator - coordinates all sub-agents |
| `gtd-research-processor` | Sonnet | URL analyzer - creates literature notes and zettels |
| `action-item-extractor` | Haiku | Extracts actionable tasks from research outputs |
| `research-post-processor` | Haiku | Updates org files, journal, and industry landscape |
| `podcast-creator` | Sonnet | Gemini Notebook integration - creates podcasts from sources |

    max_sources: 10
    min_sources: 3

  # Daily processing
  daily_processing:
    enabled: true
    min_podcasts: 2

```

## Gemini Notebook CLI

The module drives Gemini Notebook (renamed from NotebookLM, July 2026) through
[`notebooklm-py`](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py):

```bash
notebooklm create "Title"                                   # create a notebook
notebooklm source add --notebook <id> <url-or-path>         # add a source
notebooklm generate audio --notebook <id> "instructions"    # queue an audio overview
notebooklm artifact list --notebook <id>                    # check status
notebooklm auth check --test --json                         # expect "status": "ok"
```

Install it in its own environment — a system `pip` is blocked by PEP 668 on
modern macOS and Debian:

```bash
uv tool install 'notebooklm-py[browser]'    # or: pipx install 'notebooklm-py[browser]'
```

**The legacy `nlm` Go CLI is a fallback only.** Since roughly September 2026 its
audio *and* video creation RPCs return "One or more arguments are invalid" for
every argument combination, on freshly refreshed auth, while its notebook and
source calls still succeed — upstream last pushed 2026-07-31 and has not
followed Google's API change. On a host with only `nlm`, the notebook and its
sources are still created, no audio is produced, and the run says so.

Video generation is intentionally not wired up.

## Pipeline Entrypoint (canonical since 2026-07-14)

The full pipeline implementation lives HERE, in `lib/research_orchestrator.py`
(moved from the nightshift module, which keeps only a forwarding shim):

```bash
python3 .datacore/modules/research/lib/research_orchestrator.py [--limit N] [--dry-run] [--no-podcast]
```

- Parses url-bearing TODOs from research_learning.org (all collected, sorted
  [#A] first, capped at --limit; URL-less reading digests never consume slots)
- Fetch chain: subscription cookies → Jina → direct → Wayback
- Writes literature notes, zettels, CRM entities, landscape rows; marks items DONE
- Podcast: creates a NotebookLM notebook via `nlm`, adds sources, queues the
  audio overview. Two `nlm` constraints, both of which have silently broken
  this pipeline before:
  - **Audio instructions MUST be empty** — `create-audio <id> ""`. Any custom
    instruction routes to the old RPC, which the server rejects with
    "One or more arguments are invalid". Set instructions in the web UI.
  - Old-style verbs (`create`, `add`, `create-audio`) still work as deprecated
    aliases on v0.1.1, which all hosts now run. `notebook create` / `source add`
    / `audio create` are the current spellings.
- Config: module.yaml settings (`notebooklm_path`, `nlm_path`, `podcast_output_dir`,
  `reports_output_dir`, `literature_output_dir`, `zettel_output_dir`,
  `research_org_file`) are wired with fail-safe fallbacks; `NOTEBOOKLM_BIN` env
  overrides `notebooklm_path`; `NLM_BIN` overrides the legacy `nlm_path`

### Agent usage (Winston / Miles / any agent)

- **Run it**: invoke the entrypoint above; `--dry-run` is safe reconnaissance.
- **Check output**: podcasts land in `0-personal/content/podcasts/`, notes per
  Output Locations. A run that reports `Processed: 0` with a non-empty queue,
  or a skipped podcast stage, is a FAILURE signal — surface it, don't stay silent.
- **Update it**: this module is tracked in the root Data repo
  (datacore-one/datacore) — commit + push there. The nightshift repo needs no
  changes for research behavior.
- **Auth**: nlm auth is derived from browser cookies, so it can ONLY be
  refreshed on the Mac — the servers have no browser and can never renew
  themselves. It expires roughly monthly. This is automated:

      .datacore/modules/research/lib/nlm_auth_sync.py check   # status, all hosts
      .datacore/modules/research/lib/nlm_auth_sync.py sync    # refresh + push

  A weekly cron on the Mac (Sun 21:00, ahead of the Monday research run) runs
  `sync`. Left unautomated, both servers aged out on 2026-07-14 and the podcast
  stopped being produced for a month without anyone being told.

## Integration with Nightshift

Nightshift is scheduling only: `nightshift-research.timer` (02:00 UTC) runs
`nightshift run --command=/research-daily`, which dispatches to the entrypoint
above. Results feed the morning briefing.
